# kitsu-add-favourite-character
Add your favourite character using its ID as sometimes Kitsu won't show your character in the search

## How to use

1. go to the anime/manga page for the character you want to add.
2. open the url for the image of the character and copy the id there

3. download the executable from the releases page that corresponds with your operating system.
4. run it and fill in your username, password, and finally paste the id of the character that you copied above (you may have to use `ctrl + shift + V` for this)
